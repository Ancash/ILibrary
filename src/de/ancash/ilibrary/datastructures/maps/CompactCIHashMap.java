/**
 * Useful Map that does not care about the case-sensitivity of keys
 * when the key value is a String.  Other key types can be used.
 * String keys will be treated case insensitively, yet key case will
 * be retained.  Non-string keys will work as they normally would.
 * <p>
 * This Map uses very little memory (See CompactMap).  When the Map
 * has more than 'compactSize()' elements in it, the 'delegate' Map
 * is a HashMap.
